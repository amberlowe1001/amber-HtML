        The Classic Burger 1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef 1 large egg 1/2 cup minced onion 1/4 cup fine dried bread crumbs 1 tablespoon Worcestershire 1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced About 1/2 teaspoon salt About 1/4 teaspoon pepper 4 hamburger buns
        (4 in. wide), split About 1/4 cup mayonnaise Directions Step 1 In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions
        and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</p>
        Step 2 Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no
        longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</p>
        Step 3 Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Step 4 Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.
